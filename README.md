for example one #include <iostream> : -includes a library that allows us to use cout (to print messages). ,

-using namespace std; : makes writing simpler (otherwise, we’d have to type , 

-int main(): Every C++ program must have a main() function—this is where the program starts.,

-cout<< :in that program was helping us to display the message we wanted to see,

-return0; : helps us to check if the programs executed successfully,

-{} : these braces are used to help us call the function without using function calls,



For example two : ,
#include <iostream> : -includes a library that allows us to use cout (to print messages). ,

-using namespace std; : makes writing simpler (otherwise, we’d have to type , 

-int main(): Every C++ program must have a main() function—this is where the program starts., 

-int age = 20;: this is the declaration and at the same time initialisation with specified data type,

-// Integer variable: this is the comment ,

-double price = 19.99;: this is the declaration and at the same time initialisation with specified data type, 

-// Double variable:  this is the comment,

-char grade = 'A'; : this is the declaration and at the same time initialisation with specified data type,

// Character variable: this is the comment,

-string name = "Alice";  this is the declaration and at the same time initialisation with specified data type,

-// String variable: this is the comment,

-cout << "Name: " << name << endl; : this one will help to display name as it is inside the quotation marks, name you entered and also allow your program to start another line by that endl,

-cout << "Age: " << age << endl;: this one will help to display age as it is inside the quotation marks, age you entered and also allow your program to start another line by that endl,

-cout << "Price: $" << price << endl; : this one will help to display price as it is inside the quotation marks, price you entered and also allow your program to start another line by that endl,

-cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;: this one will help to display grade as it is inside the quotation marks, grade you entered and also allow your program to start another line by that endl,

-return0; : helps us to check if the programs executed successfully,

-{} : these braces are used to help us call the function without using function calls,


For example three: the new thing there is cin >> this is used to initialise when you didn't initialise at the decralation,

and we have this message telling you to  "Enter your name: " ,  

we also have this phrase saying 'cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;': which will display 'hello (the name you entered) ! you are (the age you entered) and then years old',



For example four we have the following initialisation and declarations (int a = 10, b = 3;),

And this will display the summation of a and b (cout << "Sum: "<< a + b << endl;),

this will also display the difference between a and b (cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl;),

cout << "Product: " << a * b << endl;: this will help us to display the product of a and b,

cout << "Quotient: " << a / b << endl; this will allow our program to display the quotient of a and b,

cout << "Remainder: " << a % b << endl; this will display the remainder of the division between a and b  .
