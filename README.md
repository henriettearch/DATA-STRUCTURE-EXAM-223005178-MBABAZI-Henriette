For example two : ,
#include <iostream> : -includes a library that allows us to use cout (to print messages). ,
-using namespace std; : makes writing simpler (otherwise, we’d have to type , 
-int main(): Every C++ program must have a main() function—this is where the program starts.,
-int age = 20;: this is the declaration and at the same time initialisation with specified data type,
-// Integer variable: this is the comment ,
-double price = 19.99;: this is the declaration and at the same time initialisation with specified data type, 
-// Double variable:  this is the comment,
-char grade = 'A'; : this is the declaration and at the same time initialisation with specified data type,
// Character variable: this is the comment,
-string name = "Alice";  this is the declaration and at the same time initialisation with specified data type,
-// String variable: this is the comment,
-cout << "Name: " << name << endl; : this one will help to display name as it is inside the quotation marks, name you entered and also allow your program to start another line by that endl, 
-cout << "Age: " << age << endl;: this one will help to display age as it is inside the quotation marks, age you entered and also allow your program to start another line by that endl,
-cout << "Price: $" << price << endl; : this one will help to display price as it is inside the quotation marks, price you entered and also allow your program to start another line by that endl,
-cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;: this one will help to display grade as it is inside the quotation marks, grade you entered and also allow your program to start another line by that endl,
    
-return0; : helps us to check if the programs executed successfully,
-{} : these braces are used to help us call the function without using function calls,
